## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### Screenshot
The default theme of the website is based on the current user OS theme choice. If its dark, then the theme will be set to dark, if its light, light theme will be applied. However, if the user is using a custom theme, it will go with no-preference-theme (the third theme).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom theme selector with prefers-color-theme
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What do you need to know to make this? 

You can build this with any frontend language that you're comfortable with but you'll need to know the basics of css grid, and I also recommend you understand how to make a custom theme selector


### Useful resources
- [CSS Grid Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o) - This is an amazing tutorial by travery media which helped me get a concrete basic understanding of css grid.
- [Usage of Prefers-color-theme](https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/) - This is an amazing article helped understand the historical background and theory of dark mode in addition to how to use the prefers-color-theme css feature. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning the prefers-color-scheme.
